Version 0.60 - 2011-11-xx
    - Calculation of font size is now much more precise
    - Padding settings now moved to CSS file, so they can be
        * customized without changing the JS file
        * be different from screen to PDF/print version
    - Fixed ULs and OLs so list markers are inside the div and
      there's no risk of them crossing boundaries
    - Some code refactoring/optimization
