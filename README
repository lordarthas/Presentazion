   HTML/JS software to present slides in DWIM way
   Version 0.60 - November 18th, 2011
   Author: Michele Beltrame
   License: Artistic (Perl5) or GPL3, at user choice


Do-What-I-Mean software to create presentation slides and display
them using a web browser.

USAGE:
    open presentazion.html and press "h"

SLIDES CREATION:
    See https://github.com/lordarthas/Presentazion/wiki/Usage

FEATURES & GOALS:
    See presentazion.html

PDF EXPORT:
    Run pdfexport.sh - you need wkhtmltopdf
    Works as it should, even though at present a single resolution is
    supported (but you can tweak the script and the CSS to change that)

    If you see weird output, comment out the screen CSS <link> tag: for some
    reason wkhtmltopdf still uses that even if you tell it to use the
    print CSS (sik).
