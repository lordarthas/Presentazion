Do-What-I-Mean software to create presentation slides and display
them using a web browser.

USAGE:
    open presentazion.html and press "h"

SLIDES CREATION:
    see source code
    Multislides: see wiki page on github for specs
      Multislides is EXPERIMENTAL and specs could change!

FEATURES & GOALS:
    see presentazion.html

PDF EXPORT:
    run pdfexport.sh - you need wkhtmltopdf
    Works as it should, even though at presentt a single resolution is
    supported (but you can tweak the script and the CSS to change that)

    If you see weird output, comment out the sceen CSS <link> tag: for some
    reason wkhtmltopdf still uses that even if you tell it to use the
    print CSS (sik).

TODO:
    - improve search (wrap, backwards, ...)
    - mouse navigation
    - improve PDF export (resolution choice, ...)
